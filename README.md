# FruitApp

This is an Android Compose app that fetches data from the a web API (https://www.fruityvice.com/). Response include a list with fruits and information about them. Those are presented in a scrollable list on the home page. Users can click on each of them to get all the data about the specific fruit and also add / remove it from favourites. Fruits that are added to favourites are saved in an internal Room database.

The project was developed by me (Petko Mikov) as a final exam for the course 76254A Engineering of Mobile Systems taught by Prof. Niccol√≤ Pretto in the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano during the 1st semester of the 2023/24 study year.
